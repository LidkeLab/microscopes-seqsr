# Troubleshooting

## Everything seems to work without error, but no fluorescence is detected. 
 - Shutter may not be set to remote mode. Hold the 'enable' button down for 3 seconds to toggle manual/remote mode.   
 
## Fluorescence has low/high mixed up or alternates between them incorrectly
- Flip mount was reset to the wrong mode. Set to 'go to position' (instead of toggle) using Kinesis.
